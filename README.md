# react-native-idpass-smartshare

A Secure Communications Library For Sharing Credentials

## Steps to test run the minimal example app

The use of Java version 1.8 is recommended and has been tested to be smoothly compatible for this project. This project's intial setup was generated by `npx create-react-native-library react-native-idpass-smartshare` template project structure and settings.     

```sh
git clone https://github.com/idpass/react-native-idpass-smartshare
cd react-native-idpass-smartshare/
npm install
cd example/
npm install
npx react-native start

# open another terminal
cd react-native-idpass-smartshare/example
npx react-native run-android
```

## Installation

```sh
npm install react-native-idpass-smartshare
```

## Usage

Import in main app:

```javascript
import BluetoothApi from "react-native-idpass-smartshare"
```

## Bluetooth API Description

First, a connection code or `params` needs to be communicated out-of-band and not via this library. This connection code specifies the intended peer to connect to. The mechanism to communicate the `params` connection code is up to the application. Such mechanism would include, but is not limited to, through a QR code for example.

The app that *displays the QR code* shall generate the ephemeral connection parameters:

```javascript
var params = BluetoothApi.getConnectionParameters()
console.log(params)

// Use any out-of-band mechanism to communicate the value of params to the peer device.
// For example, you can use a QR code generator library to visually display params.
```
The connection code or `params` looks like:

```javascript
{
  "cid": "1ejpu",
  "pk": "819176777955C098B78BAF949084A4484AEC5A769CED2307D59E46DC85A0F758"
}
```

The app that *scans the QR code* shall set its connection parameters:

```javascript
// Use any out-of-band mechanism to get the value of params of the peer device.
// For example, you can use a QR code scanning library to get params

BluetoothApi.setConnectionParameters(params)
```

Both apps create the connection:

```javascript
BluetoothApi.createConnection("dual", () => {
  // A secure Bluetooth connection is created
  // Anytime, either app may call BluetoothApi.send()
})
```

Once the connection is created, either app can send a string message. 

```javascript
BluetoothApi.send(msg, () => {
  // message sent
})
```

The app can intentionally destroy the connection. 

```javascript
BluetoothApi.destroyConnection()
```

The app must handle *Nearby* events in order to receive **messages**, to monitor transfer **status** of incoming/outgoing messages, or to monitor connection related **events**:

```javascript
BluetoothApi.handleNearbyEvents((event) => {
    switch (event.type) {
    case "msg":
    console.log(event.data)
    break;

    case "onDisconnected":
    console.log("onDisconnected:" + event.data)
    break;

    case "transferupdate":
    console.log("transferupdate:" + event.data)
    break;

    default:
    break;
  }

})
```

The React Native app can print native debug **logs** for debugging, by:

```javascript
BluetoothApi.handleLogEvents((event) => {
  console.log(event.log)
})
```

## Non-dual Bluetooth Connection Creation Mode

The above example snippets illustrated the use of the **dual** Bluetooth connection creation mode, wherein both devices will actively attempt to connect to each other and depending on who does it first, a connection is thereby created. The **dual** mode is a more robust mechanism to create a connection. However, an application may opt to configure one device as the `advertiser` and the other as the `discoverer`. For example, the first app that displays the QR code will advertise its presence and waits for a connection by:

```javascript
BluetoothApi.createConnection("advertiser", () => {
  // A secure Bluetooth connection is created
  // Anytime, either app may call BluetoothApi.send()
})
```

and the other app that scans the QR code will attempt to discover the first app by:

```javascript
BluetoothApi.createConnection("discoverer", () => {
  // A secure Bluetooth connection is created
  // Anytime, either app may call BluetoothApi.send()
})
```

This secure Bluetooth communication library needs to be used with another mechanism, for example a QR code, for the exchange of a connection parameters (params). This library uses asymmetric cryptography with ephemeral keys to secure the payload with [Authenticated Encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption).
